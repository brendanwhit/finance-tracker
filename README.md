# finance-tracker

A small side project to help me keep track of my finances better.

First step is to create an interactive widget on my computer that I can keep track of my finances.

Then, I want to move the database to the web so I can add to it from my phone,
which also requires creating a small app for my phone.

Another option is to get the info from my statements as they are updated to practice with API interfacing.
That will be for another day.

## Server

My finance tracker will be hosted using NGINX software on my backup laptop.
